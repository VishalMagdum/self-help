                    <h2>1) Life Coaching:</h2>
                    <p>Life coaches work with clients as individuals or groups to reach goals that may be related to
                        their business, relationships, health, or self-improvement. It is best suited for those who are
                        emotionally stable and motivated for positive change in some aspect of their life. It tends to
                        be more costly than psychotherapy, due to lack of insurance coverage.</p>
                    <h2> What Is Life Coaching?</h2>
                    <p>Life coaching is intended to help a client reach their potential in terms of who they want to
                        be or what they want to accomplish. There are three core concepts involved in any life
                        coaching process.</p>
                    <h3>Core Concepts of Life Coaching</h3>
                    <p>First, there must be a belief in the capacity for change and a motivation for change on the part
                        of the client. Both the coach and the client must believe that change is possible for anyone who
                        desires it and is willing to work at it. The underlying assumption is that people are creative,
                        resourceful, and growth oriented</p>
                    <p>Secondly, development of an increase in the client’s self-awareness is crucial to the life
                        coaching process. This includes being willing to acknowledge one’s current strengths and
                        limitations so that realistic attainable goals may be set for the future. Likewise, increased
                        self-awareness of values and hopes for the future is encouraged.</p>
                    <p>
                        A third core concept of life coaching is the importance of setting goals, followed by the
                        client’s acceptance of accountability for reaching those goals. All life coaches facilitate the
                        setting of goals by the client. With the coach’s help, a general statement of goals from the
                        client becomes developed into specific measurable goals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What’s the Goal of Life Coaching and Who Determines the Goal?</h3>
                    <p>The goal of life coaching is to enable a client to reach their potential in any given aspect of
                        their life. While the life coach asks questions to encourage self awareness and thought, the
                        client must decide what it is that they want to be different in their lives. Once the vision of
                        the future is established, the coach works with the client to figure out how to bring about
                        those changes.</p>

                    <h2>What Can Life Coaching Help With?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Life coaching can help with a wide range of future-oriented outcomes. These may be related to
                        the client’s work, relationships, life/work balance, or general contentment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specific examples include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved performance at work as seen in greater productivity</li>
                        <li>Improved work performance in terms of better efficiency</li>
                        <li>Increased self-confidence</li>
                        <li>Improved relationships (more cooperation, less conflict, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Improved communication skills</li>
                        <li>Better balance of time spent at work vs. at home</li>
                        <li>Improved time management at home</li>
                        <li>mproved effectiveness of a working team</li>
                        <li>Improved physical health and emotional well-being</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>What & Who Is Life Coaching Not Right For?</h3>
                    <p>Life coaching is not recommended for coping with mental illness, acute distress, or unresolved
                        past issues. It is also not effective for individuals who are resistant to making changes in
                        their lives, or who are seeking support as the primary intervention. Life coaching is not
                        psychotherapy and can not substitute for therapeutic intervention or counseling. It is not a
                        friendship; it is a working relationship.</p>
                    <p>Issues for which life coaching is not right (is not recommended or suitable) include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clinical depression, including Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder</li>
                        <li>Chronic or acute anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
                        </li>
                        <li>Those with unresolved problems from the past, such as unresolved grief or anger due to past
                            trauma</li>
                        <li>Serious mental illness, such as Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder</li>
                        <li>Personality Disorders which include eccentric behaviors (Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal)
                        </li>
                        <li>Personality Disorders which involve dramatic or erratic behaviors (Antisocial, Borderline,
                            Histrionic, Narcissistic)</li>
                        <li>Desire for emotional support without intention of making changes</li>
                        <li>Need for athletic coaching/training</li>
                        <li>Those who view their life as “good enough” and feel no need for change</li>
                        <li>Those who want to be directly told “what to do”</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
