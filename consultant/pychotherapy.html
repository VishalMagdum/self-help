                    <h2>3) Psychotherapy: How It Works & Who It’s Right For</h2>
                    <p>Psychotherapy, also called counseling or “therapy,” is an effective frontline treatment for
                        mental health and substance use issues.1 Therapy is usually provided by licensed psychologists,
                        social workers, and counselors in one to two hour sessions. Many individuals who receive therapy
                        see positive changes in their mood, thinking patterns, behaviors, relationships, and ability to
                        function.
                    </p>
                    <p>Therapy can provide benefits that are equal or greater than the benefits of some medication
                        alone. The benefits in therapy can also happen faster, last longer, and come with fewer side
                        effects than medication.2,4 These outcomes strongly depend on the individual, the seriousness of
                        the disorder being treated, and the relationship between the licensed therapist and the client.
                    </p>
                    <p>herapy can be provided in individual, group, family, or couples sessions. Some therapists provide
                        in-person sessions in an office setting, but online therapy has also become increasingly
                        popular. Therapists use a variety of different styles and approaches, and finding someone with
                        an approach that is right for you makes it more likely you will benefit from therapy, as the
                        relationship between the licensed therapist and the client is crucial for a positive outcome.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What Is Psychotherapy?</h2>
                    <p>Unlike psychiatrists who treat mental health symptoms with medication, therapists use talk
                        therapy to help clients address root issues, learn more about themselves, and make positive
                        behavior changes that improve their mental health.</p>
                    <h3>Psychotherapy vs. Counseling</h3>
                    <p>Today, most therapists would agree that psychotherapy, therapy, and counseling all describe the
                        same treatment. Psychotherapy is a somewhat dated term that was created to describe early
                        methods of counseling, which have since evolved and expanded to include a wide range of
                        different types, styles, and approaches.</p>
                    <h3>How Does Psychotherapy Work?</h3>
                    <p>Researchers know that therapy works, but are less clear on how or why it works. What has become
                        clear from research is that the type of therapy a person gets only plays a small part in the
                        process. Most researchers agree that finding a “good fit” between the client and therapist is
                        the most important factor that determines whether therapy will be helpful.</p>
                    <p>The factors that have the most influence on the effectiveness of therapy include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal preference: What style, approach, and type of therapy a person prefers, including
                            the characteristics they look for in a therapist</li>
                        <li>Expectations: Whether the client expects to benefit from therapy and how much they expect to
                            benefit, with too low or too high of expectations leading to poorer results</li>
                        <li>Trust: Whether the client feels comfortable opening up to a therapist and the extent to
                            which they feel their therapist is knowledgeable, trustworthy, and truly invested in them
                        </li>
                        <li>Collaboration: Whether the client and therapist are able to build a collaborative
                            relationship where they communicate and work well together</li>
                        <li>Consensus: Whether the client feels like they are on the same page with the therapist about
                            what the problem is, what the goal is, and how to reach it</li>
                        <li>Engagement level: How motivated and engaged the client is in therapy and whether they are
                            ready, willing, and able to make changes in their life</li>

                    </ul>
                    </p>
